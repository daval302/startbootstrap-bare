# [Start Bootstrap - Bare (AngularJs version)](https://daval302.github.io/startbootstrap-bare-angularjs/)

This is a fork from [Bare](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/bare/) to make it as an [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/) version.

The template has already the `main` angularjs controller and two angular template pages from the original `index.html` : **Navigator** and **Content**.
